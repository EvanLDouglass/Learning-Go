Exercises to get familiar with the Go programming language.
Different folders in this repository correspond to different classes/tutorials/etc.

The Udemy_LearnGo folder contains exercises from the Udemy course "Learn How To Code: Googleâ€™s Go (golang) Programming Language.
These are generally more basic examples to become familiar with the syntax.
However, the course is very in depth and does get into more complicated areas, including Go's built in support for multi-threading.
